   <p><h2>Volleyball is a game played by 2 teams, who are seperated by a net in the middle of a court. There are 6 players in each team.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>To play Volleyball you need to understand the positions and rules first:</h2>
    <!-- positions -->
        <dl>
             <li style="color: blue;">Outside Hitter aka OH, outside, pin, left side</li>
            <dd>outside hitter hits and blocks from the left side of the court.
                Normally, they also carry the responsibilities of passing and playing 
                defense when they get to the back row. The outside typically gets the 
                most sets, especially when the setter is out of the system, due to the 
                fact that the outside set is one of the easier options to set. An outside’s 
                responsibilities include hitting from the front and back row, passing in 
                serve receive, playing left or middle-back defense, and blocking.</dd>

            <hr>
            <br>
            <li style="color: blue;">Opposite Hitter (aka OPP, pin, right side)</li>
            <dd>Opposite hitters earned that title because they are opposite to the strong 
                (left) side hitter, meaning they hit behind the setter. In a 6-1, just like 
                an outside hitter, an opposite has the option to play all the way around, passing,
                 playing defense, and hitting out of the back row. An opposite’s responsibilities
                  include swinging from the front and back row, playing right-back defense, and blocking
                   the other team’s outside hitter.</dd>
            <img src="aditionals for volleyball/OPP.jpg" height="200" width="300">
            <hr>
            <br>
            <li style="color: blue;">Middle Blocker (aka MB, middle hitter, middle)</li>
            <dd>Middle blockers are the team’s best blockers, 
                and they hit mostly fast-tempo sets from the middle 
                of the court and behind the setter. Typically the libero
                 goes in for the middle when he or she rotates to the back row. 
                 Middle sets are some of the most difficult to set and require good passes,
                  therefore middles often get the fewest sets but have the best-hitting percentages.</dd>
            <img src="aditionals for volleyball/MB.jpg" height="200" width="300">
            <hr>
            <br>
            <li style="color: blue;">setter (aka S)</li>
            <dd>A setter’s primary responsibility is to take the second ball and 
            set it up for one of the hitters to attack. Often referred to as 
            the quarterback, the setter is the decision-maker of the team and is in
             charge of leading the offense. In a 6-1, the setter plays all the way around, 
             meaning that he or she has defensive responsibilities, as well as blocking duties 
             when in the front row. A setter’s responsibilities include setting the ball on the 
             second contact to the hitters on the court, directing the offense, playing right-back defense,
             and blocking the other team’s outside hitter.</dd>

            <hr>
            <br>
            <li style="color: red;">Libero(aka L)</li>
            <dd>Liberos wear a jersey of a different color and play 
                in the back row five out of the six rotations, usually
                 subbing in for both middle blockers. When the libero comes 
                 in for another player, it does not count as a substitution. 
                 Liberos are defensive and serve-receive specialists who are typically 
                 fast and are able to change direction quickly. Liberos are not permitted to
                  attack the ball from above the height of the net, and they can only overhand set a 
                  front-row attacker from behind the 10-foot line.</dd>

            <hr>
            <br>
            <li style="color: blue;">Defensive Specialists (aka DS)</li>
            <dd>Much like a libero, a defensive specialist plays in the back row
                 and is responsible for playing defense and receiving serve. 
                 Unlike the libero, they do not wear different colored jerseys 
                 and are required to abide by the normal substitution rules, meaning 
                 they are only in for three out of the six rotations.</dd>

        <h2><dl>now here are some rules of volleyball</dl></h2>
        <dl><h2>rules</h2></dl>
        <dd>The number of players in volleyball is six on each side, with the teams separated by a net in the middle.

            The team that wins the pre-game coin toss gets the opportunity to serve the ball first. The aim of the
             server is to hit the ball over the net from behind the baseline over to the opposition’s team half to start a rally.
            
            Teams are allowed a maximum of three consecutive touches after which they have to send the ball into the 
            opposition’s half. The player that receives the serve, attempts to control the ball and loop it in the direction of one 
            of their team-mates. This is known as the ‘pass’ or the ‘bump set’ which is executed with the forearms.
            
            The player that gets the second touch is usually the ‘setter’, who loops the ball up as close to the edge of the net 
            as possible setting up a smash, known as a ‘spike’ in volleyball.
            
            The opposition team attempts to block the ball by often positioning their tallest and most athletic players
             close to the net and the rally continues until one of the teams commits a fault or if the ball hits the ground.</dd>
        <dl><h2>volleyball court size</h2></dl>
        <dd>
            As per FIVB guidelines and volleyball rules, an volleyball court is 18m long and 9m wide.
            
            The volleyball court is split into two halves of 9m each and has a net. The top of the 
            volleyball net is 2.43m tall net for men’s and 2.24m tall for women’s competition.
            
            The attack line that separates the frontcourt and backcourt is 3m from the net on either side of the two halves.
            
            The FIVB approved volleyball ball weighs 260-290gms and has a circumference of 65-67cm with a psi of 4.3-4.6.

        <H2>and now tactics come in</H2>
        <dd><H3>1. Effective Communication:</H3></dd>
            <dl>Volleyball is a team sport that requires constant communication among players.
             From calling out who's taking the ball to discuss serving strategies, effective
              communication is a crucial aspect of the game.
            Strategy: Make sure your team is comfortable communicating openly and clearly.
             Develop a set of standard calls and signals that everyone understands. As you become more advanced, 
             you can even use misdirection and coded messages to confuse your opponents and gain a strategic edge.
        <br>
            <img src="aditionals for volleyball/effective comms.jpg" height="200" width="300">
        </dl>
        <dd><H3>2. Serving Strategy</H3></dd>
            <dl> is the only time in a volleyball game when you have complete control over the ball.
         Thus, it's a crucial moment to put your strategic plan into action.
         Strategy: Vary your serves to keep your opponents guessing. Change the speed, 
         direction, and type of serve to prevent them from getting too comfortable. Additionally, 
         aim your serves at weaker receivers or into gaps (also called the “seam”) in the opposing team's. 
         <br>
            <img src="aditionals for volleyball/Serving Strategy.jpg" height="200" width="300">
        </dl>

        <dd><H3>3. Positional Play:</H3></dd>
            <dl>Understanding where to be on the court at any given moment is critical i
            n volleyball. Good positioning can disrupt the opponent's game plan and give your team an advantage.
            Strategy: Familiarize yourself with the responsibilities of each position in volleyball - setter, 
            outside hitter, middle blocker, libero, and so on. This understanding can help you anticipate the
             ball's path and put yourself in the right place at the right time. On defence, positioning yourself
              based on the opponents' positioning and tendencies can help you block attacks more effectively.
        <br>
            <img src="aditionals for volleyball/Positional Play.jpg" height="200" width="300">
            </dl>
        
        <dd><H3>4. Attacking Strategy:</H3></dd>
            <dl>Effective attacking is about more than just powerful hits. It also involves strategic decision-making 
                to exploit the weaknesses in the opponent's defence.
                Strategy: Work on different types of attacks, like tips, rolls, and off-speed shots, in addition to hard hits. 
                Also, aim your attacks at specific areas of the court to take advantage of open spots or weaker defenders. Having a
                 diverse range of attacks makes your team harder to defend against.
        <br>    
            <img src="aditionals for volleyball/Attacking Strategy.jpg">
            </dl>

        <dd><H3>5. Defensive Strategy:</H3></dd>
            <dl>A strong defence can be just as potent as a strong offence in volleyball. Being able to consistently 
                prevent the opponents from scoring can put them under pressure and create scoring opportunities for your team.
                Strategy: Study your opponents' attacking tendencies and adjust your blocking and digging strategies accordingly.
                 For example, if an opponent often hits cross-court, position your blockers and defenders to cover that area. Also,
                  work on transitioning quickly from defence to offence to catch your opponents off guard.
                Rotation Strategy:
                the rotation system in volleyball is vital, especially when playing at a higher level. It's important not only to 
                abide by the rules but also to ensure that the right players are in the right positions at the right time.
                Strategy: Be aware of your team's rotation order and your positions responsibilities in each rotation. This includes
                 knowing when you should be preparing to serve, attack, set, or defend. Using a strategic rotation can help match up your
                  best blockers against the opponents' strongest hitters, or ensure that your best setter is always setting up the attacks.

            </dl>
        
        <dd><H3>7. Transition Strategy:</H3></dd>
            <dl>In volleyball, teams must constantly switch between offence and defence. 
                Mastering these transitions can give your team a significant advantage.
                Strategy: Work on quickly transitioning from defence to offence after a successful dig or block. 
                This includes getting into position for an attack as quickly as possible and having the setter ready
                 to set up the hit. Conversely, after attacking, players should immediately prepare to defend against the opponent's counter-attack.
        <br>
                <img src="aditionals for volleyball/Transition Strategy.jpg" height="200" width="300">
             ‍</dl>
        
        <dd><H3>8. Substitution Strategy:</H3></dd>
            <dl>In volleyball, teams can make substitutions to change their lineup during a game. Using substitutions strategically
                 can help you adjust to the flow of the game and counter your opponent's tactics.
                Strategy: Use substitutions to give tired players a break, strengthen your team in certain rotations (such as bringing in a
                 stronger server or blocker), or disrupt the opponents' rhythm. Remember, though,
                  that substitutions are limited, so use them wisely.
        <br>
                <img src="aditionals for volleyball/Substitution Strategy.jpg" height="200" width="300">
            </dl>
        
        <dd><H3>9. Scouting and Adjusting to the Opponents:</H3></dd>
            <dl>One of the keys to a successful volleyball strategy is being able to adjust your tactics based on your opponent's strengths and weaknesses.
                Strategy: Pay attention to the other team's tactics, player tendencies, and any patterns you can spot in their play.
                 Use this information to adjust your strategies, such as changing your serving targets, modifying your blocking strategy,
                  or exploiting gaps in their defence.
        <br>
                <img src="aditionals for volleyball/Scouting and Adjusting to the Opponents.jpg" height="200" width="300">
            
            </dl>
        
        <dd><H3>10. Mental Strategy:</H3></dd>
            <dl>Lastly, but importantly, volleyball is a mental game as much as a physical one. Staying focused, composed,
                 and confident can make a significant difference in your performance.
                Strategy: Develop routines to help you stay focused during games, such as a specific routine before serving
                 or a team cheer. Also, work on maintaining a positive attitude, supporting your teammates, and not getting 
                 discouraged by mistakes or losses.
                Remember, the best strategies are those that your team is comfortable with and can execute consistently. Start
                 by incorporating these tactics into your drop-in volleyball games, and over time, you'll develop a deeper understanding of this
                  strategic side of volleyball. And as always, remember that the goal of playing is not just to win, but to have fun and enjoy the game!
