        <h2>Volleyball History</h2>
        <p>Volleyball, a sport born in Holyoke, Massachusetts in 1895, is an Olympic team sport in which two teams of six players 
            are separated by a net. The game has changed a lot since it was first invented by William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director.
             Initially, it was called "mintonette" and was created as a combination of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball. The name was later changed
              to "volleyball" to better describe the nature of the game, where players volley the ball back and forth over a net. Over the years, volleyball has 
              evolved into a popular sport played worldwide, with professional leagues, international tournaments, and inclusion in the Olympic Games.</p>
