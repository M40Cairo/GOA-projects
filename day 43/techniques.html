        <h2>Volleyball Techniques</h2>
        <p>Volleyball involves various techniques that players use to serve, pass, set, attack, block, and defend. Here are some key techniques:</p>
        
        <h3>Serving</h3>
        <p>There are several types of serves in volleyball, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Float Serve</li>
                <li>Topspin Serve</li>
                <li>Jump Serve</li>
            </ul>
            Serving techniques involve proper ball toss, footwork, arm swing, and follow-through.
        </p>

        <h3>Passing</h3>
        <p>Passing, also known as bumping or receiving, involves using the forearms to control and direct the ball to the setter.
            Proper passing technique includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining a low, wide stance.</li>
                <li>Arms together and straight, forming a platform with the forearms.</li>
                <li>Absorbing the ball's energy with the arms and directing it to the intended target.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>Setting is the skill of accurately directing the ball to a teammate for an attack.
            Proper setting technique includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Hand position: Hands shaped like a ball, with fingers spread apart and thumbs behind the ball.</li>
                <li>Contact point: Contacting the ball with the fingertips, using soft, controlled touches.</li>
                <li>Location: Setting the ball precisely to the hitter's preferred hitting zone.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Attacking</h3>
        <p>Attacking, or spiking, is the act of hitting the ball forcefully into the opponent's court with the intention of scoring a point.
            Hitters approach the net, jump, and strike the ball with one hand using a variety of attacking techniques:
            <ul>
                <li>Cross-court spike</li>
                <li>Line spike</li>
                <li>Tip/dink</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Blocking</h3>
        <p>Blocking involves jumping and reaching to deflect or block the opponent's attack at the net.
            Proper blocking technique includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Timing: Jumping at the right moment to intercept the ball.</li>
                <li>Positioning: Moving laterally to cover the opponent's hitting angles.</li>
                <li>Penetration: Reaching over the net to block the ball on the opponent's side.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Defense</h3>
        <p>Defensive techniques include digging and sprawling to keep the ball in play.
            Players use their hands, forearms, and bodies to dig low-flying balls and prevent them from hitting the ground.
            Quick reflexes, agility, and anticipation are essential for effective defense.
        </p>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>Effective communication is a crucial technique in volleyball, allowing teammates to coordinate their movements and actions on the court.
            Players use verbal cues, hand signals, and eye contact to communicate plays, strategies, and positioning.
