        <h2>Volleyball Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Scoring:Matches are typically played as the best of 5 sets.
            Each set is played to 25 points, with a two-point advantage required to win the set.
            If the match reaches a fifth set (if necessary), it is played to 15 points, with the same two-point advantage requirement.</li>
            <li>2. Teams:
            Each team consists of six players on the court at a time: three front-row players and three back-row players.
            Teams can make unlimited substitutions during stoppages in play.</li>
            <li>3. Playing the Ball:
            Each rally begins with a serve, where one team serves the ball over the net to the opposing team.
            After the serve, teams have three contacts (touches) to return the ball over the net:
            Typically, the first contact is a pass (or bump), the second is a set, and the third is an attack (or spike).
            Players cannot touch the ball consecutively, except for blocking a shot at the net.</li>
            <li>4. Scoring Points:
            Points are awarded when the ball lands in the opponent's court or if the opponent commits a fault.
            Common faults include:
            A ball landing out of bounds.
            A player making contact with the net during play.
            A player touching the ball four times before returning it to the opponent's court.
            A player committing a double hit (two successive contacts by the same player).
            A player committing a lift (holding or catching the ball).</li>
            <li>5. Rotations:
            Players rotate positions on the court after winning a rally and earning the right to serve.
            Players must rotate in a clockwise direction when looking from above.</li>
            <li>6. Net Play:
            Players can reach over the net to block a shot, but they cannot interfere with the opponent's play until after the opponent's attack has crossed the net.
            Players are not allowed to touch the net during play.</li>
            <li>7. Libero:
            Each team may designate one player as the libero, who wears a different color jersey.
            The libero is a defensive specialist who cannot serve, attack the ball above the net, or attempt to block.</p></li>
